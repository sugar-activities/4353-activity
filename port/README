About
-----

A set of sugar components/libraries/etc to simplify writing activities.

Cornerstone purposes for this project:
* Total backwards compatibility for sugar-port API
* Run on all sugar platforms beginning from 0.82 

In most cases sugar-port could be embedded to activity's directory tree.
There is no need to include the whole sugar-port project only top level
files/directories you are using directly - sugar-port's top level entities
don't import each other.
